# Sentiment Analysis and Text Generation Project

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model and a text generation model using the IMDB dataset. The primary goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative and generate contextually relevant text based on given prompts. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically an LSTM-based model for sentiment classification and a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for text generation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [IMDB Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. 

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository. Please download it from the provided link and ensure the CSV file is named `IMDB_Dataset.csv`.
